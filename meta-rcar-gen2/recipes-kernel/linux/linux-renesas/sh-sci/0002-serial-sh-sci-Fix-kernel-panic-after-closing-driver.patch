Subject: [PATCH 02/13] serial: sh-sci: Fix kernel panic after closing driver

The rx_timer which has been set up is not deleted when driver is closed.
A timer is set up with a corresponding callback function when DMA
transfer is started.  After closing SCIF driver, opens it again, IRQs
are enabled.  At this time, time out happens and callback function,
rx_timer_fn() is executed.
